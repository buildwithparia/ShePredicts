''' N.B. 1: just a little reminder! before entering training the model era, convert all those y/n values to 1/0 
it can make your life easier when you try train your model!
most algorithms work better with numerical value...do don't risk it
I was lucky all those y/n rows have 1/0 values by default! yay! '''


'''N.B. 2: I wasn't that lucky...after double checking the dataset I saw the Cycle(R/I) column use weird 
values: 2 & 4 instead of 0/1 or R/I...so it need to be fixed...always double check...ü§®'''
